        'I believe everyone can fall in love with movement — if they respect their pace and learn to listen to their body. For me, it wasn\'t a quick path. I discovered the desire to train through personal experience — when I corrected my posture myself and felt for the first time what it means to feel stronger. I was inspired by my kinesiotherapist — and from there came the desire to help others feel strong and trust their body.',
        'I want people to believe: their body can do more than it seems. And that requires not pressure, but a clear plan, consistency, and a person beside you — someone who sees not just the body, but all of you.',
