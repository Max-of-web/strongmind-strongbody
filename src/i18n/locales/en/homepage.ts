        "I believe everyone can fall in love with movement – if they respect their own pace and learn to listen to their body. For me, it wasn't a quick path. I discovered the desire to train through personal experience – when I corrected my posture myself and felt for the first time what it means to feel stronger. I was inspired by my physiotherapist – and since then, the desire to help others feel strong and trust their body was born.",
        "I want people to believe: their body can do more than it seems. And for that, you don't need pressure, but a clear plan, consistency, and a person beside you – someone who sees not just the body, but all of you.",
        "I want people not just to train, but to change their relationship with movement – so it becomes their value for life."
