          quote: "Before working with Paulius, I'd given up on finding a solution for my chronic back pain. His approach combines careful attention to form with an understanding of the psychological aspects of pain. I'm now able to exercise without fear and have regained confidence in my body.",

        {
          quote: "Paulius understands that progress isn't linear. When I struggled with consistency, instead of making me feel guilty, he helped me identify the underlying barriers and create a more realistic approach. This mindset shift was what finally helped me stay consistent.",

        },
        {
          quote: "As someone who's tried many personal trainers, I can confidently say Paulius's approach is unique. His focus on building sustainable habits and making small, consistent changes has completely transformed how I approach fitness.",

          quote: "I appreciated how Paulius adapted my program during particularly stressful work periods. Instead of pushing me to maintain the same intensity, he modified my training to support recovery while still making progress. This flexibility made all the difference.",

          quote: "After I started working with Paulius, I learned to observe my body more closely — its position, posture, and my emotional state. This helped me understand what I can correct and improve every day. What stuck with me most was his inspiring mindset that I can help myself — that gave me so much confidence. The constant connection also made a big difference: I always knew I'd get answers to all my questions, so I felt motivated and never alone. Now I'm happiest that my pain has decreased, I trust myself more, and I know how to move safely.",

      bio: [
        "I believe everyone can learn to love movement – as long as they follow their own pace and learn to listen to their body. For me, this wasn't a quick journey. I first discovered the desire to train through personal experience – when I worked on my posture and felt, for the first time, what it means to feel stronger. Training with a physiotherapist inspired me, and from that moment, I wanted to help others feel strong and confident in their bodies.",
        "Today, I draw not only from physiotherapy but also from change psychology, which I studied in depth. This helps people overcome inner obstacles and stay consistent. That's what makes my method different: it's not about pressure, but about having a clear plan, patience, and someone by your side who sees not only your body, but all of you.",
        "My goal is for people not just to train, but to transform their relationship with movement – so it becomes a lifelong value."
